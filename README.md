# etch-a-sketch
The goal of this project is to display a grid whose individual squares will
change to a random color upon mouseover. Additionally, the squares will 
progressively darken with each interaction. A button at the top allows the user 
to input the size of the grid to be generated, up to 100x100, fitting in the 
same initial space.
